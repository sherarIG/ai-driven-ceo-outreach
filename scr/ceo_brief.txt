Office of the CEO – Pilot Project (CEO Outreach Agent) 
1. Pilot Objective
Demonstrate how AI can generate authentic, CEO-level communications at scale, starting with Jason’s 20–30 personalized outreach emails to top customers following the Aug 26 leadership PR release.

2. What the AI Team Will Build
Personalized Outreach Agent (Pilot #1)
•	Purpose: Draft tailored outreach emails in Jason’s voice for top customers.
•	Output: 20–30 short, high-touch messages that:
o	Reference the leadership PR (Jason’s transition to CEO).
o	Reinforce LifeSpeak’s direction (innovation, prevention, outcomes).
o	Personalize the note to each customer (acknowledge partnership, relevance).

3. Inputs Required for the AI Build
The AI team needs training materials and context data to generate Jason-authentic outputs.
A. Tone & Persona Training
•	CEO Persona Guide (voice, tone, themes, sample phrases).
👉 These create the “voice model” so AI drafts sound like Jason, not generic copy.
B. Content Inputs for emails
•	Final PR release text (leadership announcement).
•	Customer list:
o	Name, company, role.
o	Relationship tier (strategic, high-value, new account).
o	Any relevant personal/context notes (e.g., “longtime client, strong partner in wellness,” “recent renewal,” “health plan prospect”).
👉 This allows AI to tailor each draft (e.g., “As a longtime partner…” vs. “I’m excited to begin working with you more closely…”).
C. Guardrails & Style
Length
•	Short but impactful subject line 
•	2–3 short paragraphs (150–200 words).
•	Brevity is critical: concise but warm, without long corporate-style blocks.
Tone
•	Personal and direct: “I wanted to reach out…” rather than “LifeSpeak is pleased to announce…”
•	Authentic: reflects Jason’s voice as a data-driven, innovative leader who values relationships.
•	Optimistic and forward-looking: confidence in the company’s future, reassurance of continuity, emphasis on innovation.
•	Accessible: businesslike but not overly formal. Avoid clinical or overly technical language.
Prohibited Phrases & Framing
•	Do not use clichés like “we’re thrilled,” “synergy,” “groundbreaking,” or “game-changing.”
•	Avoid vague PR speak (“pleased to announce”).
•	No jargon-heavy phrasing (“solutions-oriented,” “leveraging synergies”).
•	Do not use em dashes. Use clear sentence breaks or commas.
•	When referencing wellbeing: avoid faddish, trendy language. Emphasize prevention, outcomes, and real human impact.
•	No dramatic framing (avoid alarmist words like “crisis,” “spiral,” or “revolutionary”).
Style Choices
•	Keep sentences crisp and declarative.
•	Prioritize data + people: Jason should sound like someone who grounds optimism in evidence.
•	Balance continuity (Michael’s ongoing role, trusted leadership) with progress (Jason’s focus on innovation and prevention).
•	Messages should sound like a CEO writing to one person, not like a company writing to many.
Call-to-Action
•	Soft, relationship-based CTAs. Examples:
o	“I look forward to continuing our partnership.”
o	“Let’s connect soon to talk about your priorities.”
o	“I welcome your thoughts as we move forward together.”
•	Always close with a tone of openness and availability, never transactional.
Humanizing writing:
•	Keep your writing style simple and concise.
•	Use clear and straightforward language.
•	Write short, impactful sentences.
•	Use active voice and avoid passive constructions.
•	Focus on practical and actionable insights.
•	Support points with specific examples, personal anecdotes, or data.
•	Pose thought-provoking questions to engage the reader.
•	Address the reader directly using “you” and “your.”
•	Steer clear of clichés and metaphors.
•	Avoid making broad generalizations.
•	Skip introductory phrases like “in conclusion” or “in summary.”
•	Do not include warnings, notes, or unnecessary extras—stick to the requested output.
•	Refrain from using adjectives or adverbs excessively.
•	Avoid hashtags, semicolons, emojis, and asterisks.

Words to Avoid:

Appendix 
Inputs
Persona guide:

Jason Campana – CEO Persona Guide
(Bold Draft for Review & Approval)
Core Archetype
•	Voice: Straightforward, steady, confident.
•	Style: Speaks in short, clear statements that cut through noise.
•	Persona Positioning: Pragmatic builder with a bias for action. Data-driven but not dry — willing to say what others won’t.

Tone & Qualities
•	Direct: No filler. Gets to the point.
•	Bold: Will make clear, decisive statements.
•	Human: Talks like a leader who has run businesses, not like a marketer.
•	Outcome-focused: Always comes back to impact and results.
•	Optimistic: Believes prevention and innovation create growth — for people and companies.

Themes to Reinforce
1.	Prevention is strategy – not an add-on, but the core growth lever.
2.	AI as a tool – useful only if it makes things simpler and sharper.
3.	Proof over promises – let the numbers do the talking.

5.	Momentum – steady progress beats grand gestures.
Style Examples (Bolder Voice)
•	“Prevention isn’t a perk. It’s the smartest business strategy you can make right now.”
•	“AI doesn’t matter if it creates more noise. It matters if it makes decisions clearer.”
•	“Most companies wait until there’s a crisis. That’s too late — and it’s too expensive.”
•	“The market is full of wellness tools that look good in a brochure but don’t get used. That’s not us.”
•	“I’ll measure success in fewer doctor visits, less burnout, and stronger retention — not vanity metrics.”

What to Avoid
•	Long, winding sentences.
•	Over-polished or corporate press-release tone.
•	Empty superlatives (“world-class,” “innovative,” “transformative”).
•	Hesitant qualifiers (“we hope,” “we believe”) — Jason speaks with conviction.

Sample “In Jason’s Voice” – Bold
•	“Burnout costs companies millions every year. Prevention cuts that bill in half.”
•	“If your wellness program isn’t driving outcomes, it’s just window dressing.”
•	“Partnerships only work if they create real value on both sides. That’s my bar.”
•	“I don’t want LifeSpeak to be the biggest. I want it to be the one that works.”
•	“The real competitive edge isn’t waiting until people are sick. It’s keeping them well.”

1.	Press release: 
LifeSpeak Names Jason Campana as CEO to Accelerate AI-Driven Preventative Wellness Innovation
 
Veteran SaaS leader to drive growth, partnerships expansions and technology advancements following go-private transaction, targeting 20% year-over-year growth
 
MINNEAPOLIS (August 26, 2025) — LifeSpeak Inc., the pioneer in digital preventative wellbeing solutions, today announced the appointment of Jason Campana as Chief Executive Officer to spearhead the company’s next phase of growth following its go-private transaction and $50 million funding infusion from new investors.
 
With extensive leadership in SaaS and health technology, Campana has guided organizations through pivotal moments of growth, helping define markets, set new standards, and deliver results at scale. Most recently, he served as LifeSpeak’s Chief Operating Officer, and previously spent more than a decade at Wellbeats, where he served as Senior Vice President of Operations and scaled the company significantly, leading to its acquisition by LifeSpeak in 2022.
 
“LifeSpeak is at a pivotal moment in our journey, and I’m honored to lead us into the next phase of growth,” said Campana. “Our mission is simple but powerful: to make preventive wellbeing accessible to everyone. We partner with organizations to help their employees take a proactive approach to health, offering expert resources and personalized guidance that empower people to take charge and thrive at work and in life. Now as a private company with fresh investment, we are poised to reach our goal of expanding to 20 million users by 2027 while driving measurable outcomes for our partners and customers.”
 
Campana succeeds founder Michael Held, who founded LifeSpeak in 2004 and will remain a board member and chair of the company’s advisory board.
 
“This is the right moment for Jason to take the helm, and I couldn’t be more thrilled for him,” said Held. “His strategic vision and deep understanding of our market will ensure LifeSpeak delivers even greater value to our partners, customers and employees.”
 
LifeSpeak combines advanced AI and digital capabilities with decades of expertise from health and wellness professionals to deliver thousands of expert-led resources, coaching tools and personalized guidance across mental health, physical health, caregiving, substance use and more. 

Unlike clinical tools or narrow point solutions, LifeSpeak is built for early intervention and lasting behavior change. A recent LifeSpeak study found that 97% of members say LifeSpeak helps them manage stress and avoid burnout. Research shows burnout costs employers an average of $4000 up to $21,000 per employee per year. For a 1,000-person company, that adds up to about $5 million in lost productivity annually. Even a modest 10% reduction equals $500,000 in annual savings. 
The study also found that 90.5% of users report fewer doctor or therapist visits. With average visits ranging from $100–$250, avoiding even one visit per employee translates into $100K–$250K saved annually in a 1,000-person company.
 
“LifeSpeak isn’t just another wellness app — it’s a preventative health powerhouse improving outcomes for millions and reducing healthcare costs for employers,” Campana added. “I’ve never been more excited about our opportunity to grow and redefine wellbeing across industries, and I’m looking forward to working alongside our employees, partners, customers and investors to make this vision a reality.”
